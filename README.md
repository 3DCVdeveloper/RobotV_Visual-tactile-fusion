Fragile materials for the 3C industry: integration of visual and tactile senses

By combining Obi Zhongguang's 3D vision technology with robot touch, high-precision grasping of brittle materials such as silicon wafers and computer chip bare chips can be achieved. Using 3D vision, robots can accurately capture the shape, size, and surface features of objects; Tactile feedback supplements visual limitations by perceiving material hardness and texture.
